# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis
For this project, I was challenged with the task of analyzing individual user messages and determining their respective sentiment, positive or negative. With a dataset comprising of approximately 350 user messages, I embarked on developing an effective natural language processing model. To ensure optimal performance, I thoroughly examined the dataset and carefully preprocessed it, preparing it for feature extraction and model development. Leveraging advanced techniques such as "Bag of Words" and "TF-IDF," I extracted the features to be utilized for model building. Subsequently, I constructed two models, logistic regression and random forest model, utilizing each both feature sets for each.
